# Assignment #1

### Student Info
**Name:**

------

### Folder Structure

**Assignment1PartA**: Empty folder for Part A of the assignment. You can open this specific folder in your IDE of choice by clicking on `File > Open` in your IDE and selecting this folder. 

**Assignment1PartB**: Unity Project Folder. You can open this specific folder in Unity by opening Unity Hub, clicking `Open` , and selecting this *folder* (Note: Open this folder on Unity instead of the entire assignment folder). 

Continue working on the assignment on Unity as you would normally do and commit + push the code using the git bash command line as specified in the `Git Fundamentals` document on nexus. You can commit the entire assignment folder at once, or you can commit subfolders separately. 

### Workflow (See Git Fundamentals document on nexus for more)

1) Clone the repo. 
2) `File > Open` in your C# IDE and open the `Assignment1PartA` folder in it. 
3) Work on the part a normally, and commit + push at the end using git bash. 
4) For part b, open Unity Hub, click `open` and select the `Assignment1PartB` folder. Let Unity build the project. 
5) Work on the project on Unity + IDE for scripts normally and commit + push using git bash terminal. 
   
**Note** that the `git add .` command adds every new change *from the current folder* to the staging area. So you can `cd assignment-1-yourname/Assignment1PartB` and then `git add .` + commit + push to push the contents of just the Part B Unity folder.
