 # Assignment 1 Part B Question 2

 Gaming to me is a source of **entertainment**. It is one of the most interactive forms of keeping yourself busy and entertained at the same time.

I would identify myself as a hardcore gamer. It is very difficult to choose an all time favourite game but i think in the modern era *spiderman* is one of the best game's i have played. Another game i play a lot is ***fifa***. Me and my friends get together and host tournaments in which we play against each other.

## Goal for this  course
I hope to develop a game similiar to mario as it is one of the all time classics. It would be fun to develop a game similiar to a game i grew up playing.
