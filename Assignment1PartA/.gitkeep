Git does not allow us to add (and hence, commit) empty folders to the repo. 

This is a random file (could be anything, but conventionally called as .gitkeep) to force git to add this file to the repo, thereby adding this otherwise empty folder to the repo. 

So, you can ignore this file and work on your assignment normally.
